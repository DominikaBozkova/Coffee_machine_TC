# Reliability Test Cases

## Test Case: Long-term operation test
- **Description**: Ensure the coffee machine can operate reliably over an extended period without failures.
- **Steps**:
  1. Turn on the coffee machine.
  2. Operate the coffee machine continuously for 30 days.
  3. Perform daily checks for any failures or performance issues.
  4. Document any issues that occurred during the testing period.
- **Expected Result**: The machine should operate without failures for the entire test period.

## Test Case: Error handling under failure conditions
- **Description**: Verify that the coffee machine handles errors under failure conditions.
- **Steps**:
  1. Turn on the Coffee Machine.
  2. Simulate various failure conditions (e.g., empty water tank, no coffee beans, component malfunctions).
  3. Observe how the machine responds to each failure condition.
  4. Check if the machine provides appropriate error messages and recovery options.
- **Expected Result**: The machine should handle errors gracefully, providing clear error messages and recovery options to the user.
