# Performance Test Cases

## Test Case: Stress test for continuous operation
- **Description**: Ensure the coffee machine can operate continuously for an extended period without performance degradation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Turn on the coffee machine.
  2. Brew coffee continuously for 8 hours.
  3. Monitor the machine's performance, including brewing time and coffee quality.
- **Expected Result**: The machine operate continuously without significant performance degradation or failure.

## Test Case: Brew time under load
- **Description**: Measure the brewing time when the machine is operating under load.
- **Steps**:
  1. Turn on the coffee machine.
  2. Simulate a high load by starting multiple brewing processes simultaneously (if the machine supports parallel brewing).
  3. Measure the time taken to brew each coffee.
- **Expected Result**: The brewing time should remain within acceptable limits even under high load.

## Test Case: Temperature consistency
- **Description**: Verify that the machine maintains a consistent temperature during multiple brewing cycles.
- **Steps**:
  1. Turn on the coffee machine.
  2. Brew multiple cups of coffee consecutively.
  3. Measure the temperature of each brewed coffee.
- **Expected Result**: The temperature of each brewed coffee is consistent and within the desired range.
