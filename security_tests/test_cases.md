# Security Test Cases

## Test Case: Access control
- **Description**: Ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations (e.g., maintenance, settings adjustment).
- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize the CoffeeMachine component.
  2. Attempt to perform a sensitive operation (e.g., enter maintenance mode, adjust machine settings) without proper authorization.
  3. Observe the machine's response to the unauthorized attempt.
  4. Authorize the user and perform the same operation.
- **Expected Result**: Unauthorized attempts should be denied, and only authorized users should be able to perform sensitive operations.
